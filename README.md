# BABEL ü§ñ

Babel is a PHP-based microservice adapter that uses the Lumen framework to manage client connections on Mikrotik devices through RouterOS API. The goal of this project is to facilitate communication between applications and Mikrotik devices, allowing for control and monitoring of data networks through an application programming interface (API).

Babel acts as an intermediary between applications and RouterOS, providing an abstraction layer that makes it easier to work with the API. As a result, tasks such as user management, setting network parameters, and monitoring network performance can be done easily and efficiently.

Babel is designed to be highly scalable thanks to its microservices-based architecture. This means it can be run on multiple instances and easily integrated into existing applications.

In summary, Babel is a useful tool for facilitating communication between applications and Mikrotik devices and provides a simple and efficient way to control and monitor data networks.

## The Purpose üìï

The Tower of Babel is a biblical story told in the book of Genesis. According to the story, the inhabitants of the city of Babel decided to build a tower that reached to the sky. God saw this and decided to confuse the language of the inhabitants so that they could not understand each other and could not finish the tower. As a result, the tower was never finished and the inhabitants scattered across the world.

The name of the BABEL project is inspired by this story, as Babel can also refer to the confusion or chaos caused by a lack of understanding or communication. In the context of this project, Babel acts as a kind of "translator" between applications and Mikrotik devices, allowing them to understand and communicate with each other efficiently. Like the Tower of Babel, this project aims to "reach the sky" in the sense of providing a simple and efficient way to communicate with Mikrotik devices.
